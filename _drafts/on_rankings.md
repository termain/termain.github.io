Firstly: Go Bulldogs! Well done! And while Bully is a truly worthy mascot, a [feist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feist_%28dog%29) is more fitting both the current team and Dan Mullen's personality and coaching style. Should Bully need a day off, I'm sure Charlie can play up the feist/terrier side of his heritage. Herding breed college football fans could use a high profile member, what with the beating [Reveille](Reveille)'s Aggies have been taking lately.

And truly, well done SEC -- particularly the West. And I mean all of the West. A single division with the 3 best college football teams in it is... well, it's quality, that's for sure. And an entire division of top 25 teams, more so. While the very idea of rankings based the mere handful of games each team plays even across a whole season is fraught with iffy assumptions and guesswork, Jeff
