Firstly: Go Bulldogs! Well done! And while Bully is a truly worthy mascot, a [feist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feist_%28dog%29) is more fitting both the current team and Dan Mullen's personality and coaching style. Should Bully need a day off, I'm sure Charlie can play up the feist/terrier side of his heritage. Herding breed college football fans could use a high profile member, what with the beating [Reveille](Reveille)'s Aggies have been taking lately.

And truly, well done SEC -- particularly the West. And I mean all of the West. A single division with the 3 best college football teams in it is... well, it's quality, that's for sure. And an entire division of top 25 teams, more so. While the very idea of rankings based the mere handful of games each team plays even across a whole season is fraught with iffy assumptions and guesswork, Jeff Sangarin's [algorithmic rankings](http://www.usatoday.com/sports/ncaaf/sagarin/) are perhaps the best objective ones that are easily available. Take a look:

   1  Auburn                 95.59
   2  Mississippi            94.21
   3  Mississippi State      93.42
   4  Oklahoma               93.29
   5  Baylor                 93.12
   6  Alabama                92.83
   7  Georgia                91.29
   8  TCU                    90.93
   9  Texas A&M              89.44
  10  Oregon                 88.30
  11  Florida State          87.60
  12  LSU                    87.26
  13  Notre Dame             86.61
  14  Michigan State         85.84
  15  Ohio State             85.78
  16  Stanford               85.37
  17  Kansas State           85.25
  18  Clemson                84.91
  19  Florida                84.88
  20  UCLA                   84.21                                  
  21  Southern California    83.81
  22  Tennessee              82.24
  23  Utah                   82.14
  24  Nebraska               82.04
  25  Arkansas               80.64

All seven SEC West teams show up. The SEC, particularly the West, is ridiculously good. Now, these are estimates, but they're objective and reasonable ones.

The top three ordering might be a surprise, with Auburn still at number one. There's a couple of things to note: 1) Home team advantage is about 3-3.5 points, so MSU would still be slightly favored in a rematch at home. 2) The algorithm ates both LSU and Arkansas highly, both teams that Auburn *disassemled*. and Auburn' margin of victory over LSU was considerably greater than the State's was. It's a tight, tight division and the Bulldogs beat the team that still may be the best in the country. That game, at least, is in the bag. Alabama still looms and they're on the road. Remember, the Empire struck *back*.  I don't want to discount Kentucky or Arkansas, they're good teams, but Alabama is almost as big a threat as Ole Miss. 

Almost. The narrative seems almost a little too pat, that State and Ole Miss would rise together only to face of in an Egg Bowl finale, but... it sure seems that way. Fittingly, Ole Miss appears our the greatest remaining challenge. Even a win there, though, likely leaves MSU to face the Occidental Dogs in their backyard. The only team that has it rougher: Auburn, with almost the same remaining schedule and they definitely have to play Georgia.
