So, this happened: 

![Bottle Cap In Drain](/assets/cap_in_drain.jpg)

I figure that enough people have baby bottle caps and sinks with drains that knowing how to address this situation could be of general interest.

It's not easy to spot from the picture, but there's actually a few centimeters of water on top of the bottle cap. A cap which has managed to seal the drain it's stuck in completely. The combination of the water on top of the cap and the air beneath it (at atmospheric pressure) created enough of a pressure difference that I couldn't pull the cap out by its ridges or threads.

Ultimately, I had to drain the sink, which was a bit tricky since the cap had it sealed. I managed to do so slowly by wedging the pictured table knife blade in between the outside of the cap and the drain rim and turning it slightly to open up enough of a gap for the water to drain. After draining it completely, with water only in the cap itself, I was able to lift cap out by its threads using the same table knife.
